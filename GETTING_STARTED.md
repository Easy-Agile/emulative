# Getting started working on Emulative

After cloning the repo run `yarn install` from the root of the repository.

You can then run `f5` to open another VSCode window with the development version of the extension running.

It is useful to have a simple TypeScript repository to work on so I recommend cloning something like [React TypeScript Todo App](https://github.com/nas5w/react-typescript-todo-app)
